A lightweight database (if possible, MongoDB is ideal)

A simple text search feature that allows users to find keywords/phrases from the stored data

endpoints:
/index - loads data from MTG api into mondoDB
/      - landing page with search form and search operators
/searchRults - shows the search results of from user input
